# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

    rubyrubyruby_p2: "During the creation of this platform I've learned how to collaborate with other developers and how to contribute to a project by the use of Github. We have learned to create branches, pull requests and not to push directly into the master-branch to prevent conflicts. We also implemented a simplefied version of scrum what meant discussing a clear goal of the day and making good use of trello which gives a clear overview of the progress of the applicaton. This project gave me solid knowlegde about the MVC model and the CRUD Methodes."

The PITCH: An application Dashboard that provides personal/relavant advice about the well-being of the user. This advice is based on data input from the user, data input from sensors and data from external api's. The goal was to build a prototype within 5 days and receive feedback from potential users. We reached this goal by implementing methods from Google Venture design sprint."
